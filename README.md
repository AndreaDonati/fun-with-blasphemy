# fun-with-blasphemy
A simple, yet fun, executable+script utility to harras your friends with randomly-generated blasphemy.

## How to use
First of all, you have to have the "telegram-cli" package installed on your Linux system.
If you already have it, just go to the "utils" folder and run the script in the terminal with the following syntax:


"./script.sh [name of your telegram contact]"

Please note that, if your contact's name has a space in it, you have to replace it with an underscore.

Have fun.
